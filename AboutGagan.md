        <h1>About Gagan</h1>
      </header>

      
      <p>Iâ€™m a designer, strategist, and coach with 20+ years of experience in product, research, and leadership. I help people find clarity, build trust, and lead with confidence.</p>

      <h2>My Path</h2>
      <p>In 2001, I founded <a href="https://designstamp.com" target="blank">DesignStamp</a>, a research and design studio that tackles complex challenges across business, tech, and public health. I have led projects for the Gates Foundation, OECD, and PEPFARâ€”the worldâ€™s largest global health initiative.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™ve created UX and management courses, taught at Vancouver Film School, delivered talks across Canada, and spent years mentoring and managing growing teams. As VP of Experience Design at Thinkific, I scaled design and research during a period of rapid growth and helped lead the company to a $1B IPO valuation.</p>

      <h2>What I Do Today</h2>
      <p>Today, I coach tech professionals and leaders, facilitate strategy workshops, and help people navigate big decisions and moments of change. I specialise in helping people see their strengths clearly, and use them more intentionally.</p>
    <p>I live in Toronto, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, and work with clients across North America and Europe.</p>

      <h2>Why Coaching</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="8u 12u$(medium)">
        <p>Iâ€™ve witnessed firsthand how even the best ideas stall when teams face unclear direction, misaligned goals, or a lack of trust and accountability.</p>

		<p>Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve been lucky to work with great coaches. Coaching created space to think, test, reflect, and act â€” helping me move with intention, even in times of uncertainty.</p>

		<p>After years in design leadership, coaching felt like a natural next step. The way we build products is broken. I want to do my part to shape healthier ways of working so we can create better outcomes together.</p>


          <blockquote>

            â€” Marian Wright Edelman
          </blockquote>

          <p>My approach blends systems thinking, user-centered design, and strategic questioning. Whether youâ€™re stepping into leadership, navigating a pivot, or trying to communicate with more impact, Iâ€™ll help you do it with clarity and purpose.</p>

          <h2>My Coaching Style</h2>
          <div class="cta-links"><p>			  
            <strong>Hope is not a plan!</strong> A coach helps you move from             <span class="fa fa-map-marker" style="color: grey;"></span> where you are  
            to <br /><span class="fa fa-trophy" style="color: grey;"></span> where you want to go ...with a plan to get there.</p>
          </div>

          <p>I coach with a mix of empathy and accountability. Iâ€™ll support you *and* Iâ€™ll  challenge you to name what you want, own whatâ€™s holding you back, and do the work to grow.</p>

          <p>I work especially well with curious people who think deeply, lead quietly, and care about others but sometimes need help speaking up, zooming out, or stepping into their full power.</p>

          <p>I believe in equity, access, and representation. Iâ€™m especially committed to supporting women, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+ leaders in shaping the future of work.</p>

                <p>Iâ€™ve been a designer, researcher, and team builder for over 20 years. Iâ€™ve worked with global NGOs, tech companies, and startups.

                <p>I work with product and design professionalsâ€”ICs, new managers, senior leaders, and teams. Some are trying to grow into their next role; others are figuring out what comes after a plateau or burnout. I also coach people navigating systems that werenâ€™t designed for them, including BIPOC, women, and LGBTQ+ professionals in tech.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Mentorship is often advice-based. Coaching is about reflection, alignment, and accountability. Each of us do better when we find our own answers instead of someone giving them to us. Iâ€™ll help you find yours, challenge your assumptions, and move toward what you want with clarity and confidence.</p>
