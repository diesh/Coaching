            <h2 id="content">Shaping the Future of Work Through Design</h2>
            <p>Driven by an innate curiosity and a passion for crafting engaging experiences, Iâ€™ve been a practitioner, mentor, and educator in the field of design for over 20 years. In 2001, I founded DesignStamp, a studio known for its innovative approach to research and user experience. My strength lies in bridging the gap between customers, businesses, and technologistsâ€”helping them understand each other's needs and collaborate seamlessly.</p>

            <p>Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve led user research and experience design initiatives for some of the worldâ€™s most influential organizations, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the OECD, and PEPFAR, the largest global initiative dedicated to combating HIV/AIDS.</p>

I am also available for <a href="OngoingCoaching.html">ongoing coaching</a> to help you level up and tackle work challenges with confidence.</blockquote>
            <p>Most recently, I served as VP of Experience Design & Research at Thinkific, an online learning platform that achieved unicorn status and went public in 2021. I helped develop the Digital Design program at Vancouver Film School and have taught courses, delivered talks, and led workshops on branding, user experience, and design thinking. I work as an executive coach, partnering with leaders and individual contributors to accelerate their careers and drive impactful, strategic initiatives. I live in Toronto, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.</p>

            <h2 id="elements">Why Coaching</h2>

            <!-- Row for Two Columns -->
            <div class="row">
                <!-- Left Column -->
                <div class="8u 12u$(medium)">
                    <p>Moving from design leadership to executive coaching felt like a natural next step. After two decades of helping businesses, customers, and technology teams work better together, I realized something: great skills and experience aren't enough to guarantee success. Exceptional teams need two other key ingredients: <br /><span class="fa fa-check" style="color: grey;"></span> Leaders who are empathetic and clear about priorities, and <br /><span class="fa fa-check" style="color: grey;"></span> The team has taken the time and effort required to build real trust.</p>

<p>Trust helps teams go from the unknown to the known, navigate uncertainty, and feel like they're truly on the same side.</p>
                    
<blockquote> You cannot be what you cannot see.
â€” Marian Wright Edelman </blockquote>
                    <p>Coaching lets me take what Iâ€™ve learned in research and experience design and apply it in a new wayâ€”helping individuals and teams gain clarity, remove roadblocks, and build strategies that drive real impact. Whether Iâ€™m working with executives, product teams, or design leaders, my approach is built on curiosity, collaboration, and the belief that leadership isnâ€™t just a title; itâ€™s a skill you can sharpen, refine, and grow. I'm here to help you <b>see yourself in a new way</b>, so that you can craft a career worth waking up for!</p>
                    
                
                <h2 id="elements">My Coaching Style</h2>
                    <div class="speechbubble">					  
						 <strong>Hope is not a plan!</strong> A coach helps you move from  
<span class="fa fa-map-marker" style="color: grey;"></span> where you are  
to where you want to be <span class="fa fa-trophy" style="color: grey;"></span> â€” equipping you with a clear plan to get there.

					 </div>
 <p>Coaching starts with trust. Before anything else, I take the time to understand youâ€”your ambitions, challenges, and what drives you. I believe great coaching is a mix of deep empathy and unwavering accountability. My role isnâ€™t just to support you but to challenge you, push you, and keep you honest in the pursuit of your goals.</p>

<blockquote>
If all lives truly mattered equally, movements like Black Lives Matter wouldnâ€™t be necessary. Initiatives like DEI exist to address the disparities we've created by valuing some lives over others. Itâ€™s about equity, not equality. My goal is to lift people up, especially those who need the most support.
</blockquote>
<p>Growth isnâ€™t always easy. Transformation takes effort, resilience, and the right kind of support. I know this firsthand. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had coaches and built my own personal board of directorsâ€”mentors who saw my blind spots, challenged my thinking, and kept me moving forward. The best support network isnâ€™t just kind; itâ€™s strong, direct, and unafraid to hold you accountable.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s the approach I bring to coaching. Iâ€™ll celebrate your wins, call out the gaps, and push you toward the clarity and confidence you need to lead with impact.</p>
