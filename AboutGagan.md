            <h2 id="content">Leading by Design</h2>
            <p>Driven by an innate curiosity and a passion for crafting engaging experiences, I’ve been a practitioner, mentor, and educator in the field of design for over 20 years. In 2001, I founded DesignStamp, a studio known for its innovative approach to research and user experience. My strength lies in bridging the gap between customers, businesses, and technologists—helping them understand each other's needs and collaborate seamlessly.</p>

            <p>Throughout my career, I’ve led user research and experience design initiatives for some of the world’s most influential organizations, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the OECD, and PEPFAR, the largest global initiative dedicated to combating HIV/AIDS.</p>

I am also available for <a href="OngoingCoaching.html">ongoing coaching</a> to help you level up and tackle work challenges with confidence.</blockquote>
            <p>Most recently, I served as VP of Experience Design & Research at Thinkific, an online learning platform that achieved unicorn status and went public in 2021. I helped develop the Digital Design program at Vancouver Film School and have taught courses, delivered talks, and led workshops on branding, user experience, and design thinking. I work as an executive coach, partnering with leaders and individual contributors to accelerate their careers and drive impactful, strategic initiatives. I live in Toronto, Canada.</p>

                    <p>Moving from design leadership to executive coaching felt like a natural next step. After two decades of helping businesses, customers, and technology teams work better together, I realized something: great skills and experience aren't enough to guarantee success. A- teams need two other key ingredients: <br /><span class="fa fa-check" style="color: grey;"></span> Leaders who are empathetic and clear about priorities, and <br /><span class="fa fa-check" style="color: grey;"></span> The team has taken the time and effort required to build real trust.</p>

<p>Trust helps teams go from the unknown to the known, navigate uncertainty, and feel like they're truly on the same side.</p>
                    
<blockquote> You cannot be what you cannot see.

                    <p>Coaching lets me take what I’ve learned in research and experience design and apply it in a new way—helping individuals and teams gain clarity, remove roadblocks, and build strategies that drive real impact. Whether I’m working with executives, product teams, or design leaders, my approach is built on curiosity, collaboration, and the belief that leadership isn’t just a title; it’s a skill you can sharpen, refine, and grow.</p>
                    
                
                <h2 id="elements">My Coaching Style</h2>
                    <div class="speechbubble">					  
						 <strong>Hope is not a plan!</strong> A coach helps you move from  
<span class="fa fa-map-marker" style="color: grey;"></span> where you are  
to where you want to be <span class="fa fa-trophy" style="color: grey;"></span> — equipping you with a clear plan to get there.

					 </div>
 <p>Coaching starts with trust. Before anything else, I take the time to understand you—your ambitions, challenges, and what drives you. I believe great coaching is a mix of deep empathy and unwavering accountability. My role isn’t just to support you but to challenge you, push you, and keep you honest in the pursuit of your goals.</p>

<blockquote>
If all lives truly mattered equally, movements like Black Lives Matter wouldn’t be necessary. Initiatives like DEI exist to address the disparities we've created by valuing some lives over others. It’s about equity, not equality. My goal is to lift people up, especially those who need the most support.
</blockquote>
<p>Growth isn’t always easy. Transformation takes effort, resilience, and the right kind of support. I know this firsthand. Throughout my career, I’ve had coaches and built my own personal board of directors—mentors who saw my blind spots, challenged my thinking, and kept me moving forward. The best support network isn’t just kind; it’s strong, direct, and unafraid to hold you accountable.</p>

<p>That’s the approach I bring to coaching. I’ll celebrate your wins, call out the gaps, and push you toward the clarity and confidence you need to lead with impact.</p>

                        <p>Depending on your needs, we'll create a plan that works for you. If you're job searching, weekly coaching often provides the momentum you need. For executives and leaders, a monthly cadence tends to be more effective—offering steady guidance while ensuring I'm available when you need support, whether it's refining a strategy deck or planning for the next quarter.</p>
