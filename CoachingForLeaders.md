            <span>How is coaching different from mentorship?</span>
            <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Coaching helps you uncover your own answers through strategic questioning and reflection. Unlike mentorship, which shares personal experience and is advice-based, coaching empowers you to shape your own leadership style and strategies.</p>
            <p>I’m here to hold up a mirror—helping you reflect on where you’ve been, where you’re going, and what’s possible. You’ll gain fresh perspectives, move forward with greater clarity, and take meaningful steps toward your goals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The results can be life-changing—if you're ready to put in the work! Once you’re willing to step outside your comfort zone and challenge your blind spots, you’ll develop sharper decision-making skills, stronger communication, and a clearer leadership vision.</p>
            <p>You’ll gain strategies to navigate conflict, drive alignment, and create lasting impact in your organization. Think of me as your co-pilot, helping you tackle tough situations and equipping you with tools to handle challenges you haven’t faced before.</p>
