				<h3>Highlights</h3>
				<p>Ongoing coaching is tailored to your unique needs, helping you overcome obstacles and achieve sustained success. Here‚Äôs what you can expect:</p>
				<ul class="coaching-highlights">
					<li>
						<b>Break Through Challenges</b><br>
						Work through difficult problems with an expert who helps you see blind spots, explore new perspectives, and find solutions to get unstuck.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Stay Accountable</b><br>
						Avoid falling into familiar traps by having someone hold you accountable to your goals, commitments, and progress.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Combat Loneliness</b><br>
						70% of professionals feel lonely at work. With ongoing coaching, you‚Äôll have a trusted ally to rely on‚Äîsomeone who understands what you‚Äôre going through and helps you navigate it with confidence.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Track Progress and Improve Performance</b><br>
						Like a gym coach for your career, we‚Äôll create a system to track your progress, celebrate wins, and identify areas for improvement‚Äîso you can keep growing and performing at your best.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Personal growth and learning to work well with others is a continuous process of growth, adaptation, and refinement. Successful people don't react to challenges; they proactively shape their path, deepen their self-awareness, and refine their impact. Coaching can provide you the structure, insight, and accountability to help you navigate complex decisions, lead with confidence, and stay ahead in an ever-changing landscape.

            <span>What‚Äôs the difference between ongoing coaching and a one-time session?</span>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A one-time session is great for addressing a specific challenge or decision, while ongoing coaching is designed for sustained growth.</p>
            <p>It allows us to track progress, refine strategies, and develop deeper leadership capabilities over time. I see ongoing coaching as a two-track approach to your career: acting as your co-pilot for immediate workplace challenges while also providing a long-term perspective on your career trajectory and how you navigate change.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>That depends on your goals. Most of my clients come to me because they want to "fix something"‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs navigating a difficult work relationship, overcoming career stagnation, or stepping into new leadership challenges.</p>
            <p>Our first few sessions will map out your journey‚Äîclarifying where you‚Äôve been, where you are now, and where you want to go.</p>
            <p>Many clients experience significant transformation within 3-6 months, but growth is an ongoing process. Some choose to continue coaching for a year or more as they take on new challenges and responsibilities.</p>
