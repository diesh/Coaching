        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Every workshop starts with a discovery session where we discuss your team’s challenges, goals, and dynamics. Based on that, I design a session with hands-on exercises tailored to your needs. I have a few folks that I can also call upon to help me co-facilitate the sessions for larger groups.

            <span>What’s the ideal team size for a workshop?</span>
            <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            The ideal size depends on the type of workshop, but typically 5-15 people allows for strong engagement and collaboration. Larger teams can benefit from more instructional workshops where we delve into topics to help build a strong culture, such as unbiased hiring, building a culture of feedback and collaboration, and structured brainstorming.

            <span>Do you offer virtual workshops or only in-person sessions?</span>
            <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            I offer both virtual and in-person workshops, depending on what works best for your team. Virtual workshops are designed to be just as interactive as in-person ones, with breakout sessions, moderated chats, and structured time for both on-camera and off-camera engagement. I'm based in Toronto and happy to travel for in-person sessions if preferred.

        <div class="faq-question">
            <span>Our team is shy / introverted / formal. Will this work for them?</span>
            <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes! These workshops are built for all team dynamics, including quieter or more formal groups. Here's how I make sure everyone feels comfortable and engaged:</p>

			<ul>
		    <li><strong>Options for participation</strong> – Not everyone loves speaking up in a big group. I use small breakouts, written reflections, and structured discussions so people can contribute in ways that feel natural.</li>
		    <li><strong>No forced interaction</strong> – Activities are designed to be inclusive but not overwhelming. Team members can ease in at their own pace. I always follow up after sessions for folks who like time to reflect before contributing.</li>
		    <li><strong>A thoughtful approach</strong> – I create a supportive, low-pressure environment where even the most reserved team members feel heard. </li>
		    <li><strong>Engagement beyond talking</strong> – Collaboration doesn’t always mean speaking up. Many exercises involve writing, sketching, or structured brainstorming so ideas flow in different ways.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Your team’s personality shapes the workshop, not the other way around. The goal is to create meaningful engagement in a way that works best for <strong>you.</strong></p>
