      <p>TL;DR AI is an assistant, not a coach. My coaching is built on trust, listening, and accountability. Our connection is human and it will never be replaced by robots.</p>

## In Coaching
- I use AI to summarize notes and surface themes from coaching sessions.  
- This helps me reduce bias and avoid tunnel vision when approaching issues with clients.  
- I have a library of prompts, frameworks, and exercises that I’ve used to shape design thinking, influence stakeholders, and manage relationships. I use AI to strip out any company specific stuff, and adapt them for my clients.  
- I use AI as a proofreader, editor, and bias check when I write documents.

## On This Website
- I am not a coder (sorry, Kim #ifykyk)! I worked with AI to write this code, co-create and refine layouts, and test design changes.  
- I used it to proof my content. It works, though I had scream at it to banish em dashes.  
- AI helps me check clarity and consistency, but I review and edit every page to communicate my intent and style.

## My Commitment to Clients
AI supports the work but does not replace it.  
- I partner with you to make choices on strategy and outcomes for our relationship.  
- Your confidentiality is protected at all times.  
- I use AI to work smarter and remove unhelpful bias, but never to replace our human connection.  

My coaching is guided by empathy, clarity, and accountability. AI is one of the tools I use, but the work we do together is always led by people. Nothing that humans create is purrfect, which is why coaching matters. We can learn from our collective past. Otherwise, what would be the point of all of this? ❤️
