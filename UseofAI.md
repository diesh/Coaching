# Use of AI

I use AI in two ways: to support my coaching practice and to help create this website. It speeds up routine tasks, helps me explore ideas, and sharpens communication. The final direction and decisions always stay with me.

## In Coaching
- I use AI to summarize notes and highlight themes from coaching sessions.  
- It helps me shape prompts, frameworks, and exercises that I adapt for each client.  
- I use it to draft examples, such as rewriting a resume point or structuring a case study, before refining them myself.  

AI is an assistant, not a coach. Coaching is built on trust, listening, and accountability. Those parts will always remain human.

## On This Website
- AI helps me troubleshoot code, refine layouts, and test design changes more quickly.  
- I use it to prototype copy such as section headings and navigation labels.  
- It checks clarity and consistency, but I review and edit every page to match my intent and style.

## My Commitment
AI supports the work but does not replace it.  
- I make the choices on tone, strategy, and outcomes.  
- Client confidentiality is protected at all times.  
- I use AI to work smarter, not to remove the human connection.  

My coaching is guided by empathy, clarity, and accountability. AI is one of the tools I use, but the work we do together is always led by people.
