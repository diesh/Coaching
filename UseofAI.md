## In Coaching
- I use AI to summarize notes and surface themes from coaching sessions.  
- This helps me reduce bias and avoid tunnel vision when approaching issues with clients.  
- I have a library of prompts, frameworks, and exercises that I’ve used to shape design thinking, influence stakeholders, and manage relationships. I use AI to strip out my own customizations and adapt them for clients.  
- I use AI as a proofreader, editor, and bias check when I write documents.  

AI is an assistant, not a coach. Coaching is built on trust, listening, and accountability. Those parts will always remain human.

## On This Website
- I am not a coder. I worked with AI to write code, refine layouts, and test design changes.  
- I used it to proof my content. It works, though I had to push it away from habits like overusing em dashes.  
- AI helps me check clarity and consistency, but I review and edit every page to match my intent and style.

## My Commitment to Clients
AI supports the work but does not replace it.  
- I make the choices on strategy and outcomes for our relationship.  
- Your confidentiality is protected at all times.  
- I use AI to work smarter and remove unhelpful bias, but never to replace our human connection.  

My coaching is guided by empathy, clarity, and accountability. AI is one of the tools I use, but the work we do together is always led by people. Otherwise, what would be the point of all of this? ❤️
