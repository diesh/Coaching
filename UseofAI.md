# Use of AI

I use AI in two ways: to support my coaching practice and to help create this website. It speeds up routine tasks, helps me explore ideas, and sharpens communication. The final direction and decisions always mine.

## In Coaching
- I use AI to summarize notes and surface themes from coaching sessions.  
- This helps me remove my bias and make sure that I am also removing horse blinders in how I am appraoching issues with clients
- I have a library of prompts, frameworks, and exercises that I have used to shape design thinking, influence stakeholders, and manage relationships and communication at work. I feed these to AI to take out my customiastions and adapt them for use by my clients
- I use AI as a proofreader, editor, and bias remover when I write documents.  

AI is an assistant, not a coach. Coaching is built on trust, listening, and accountability. Those parts will always remain human.

## On This Website
- I am not a coder! I fought with AI to write code, do things I wanted, refine layouts, and test design.
- I used it to proof my content and it did that ok except I had to fight it for its overuse of em dashes
- AI sanity checks my clarity and consistency, but I review and edit every page to match my intent and style.

## My Commitment to you, my client
AI supports the work but does not replace it.  
- I make the choices on strategy, and outcomes for our relationhip
- Your confidentiality is protected at all times.  
- I use AI to work smarter, remove some non-productive bias but will not and cannot remove our human connection.  

My coaching is guided by empathy, clarity, and accountability. AI is one of the tools I use, but the work we do together is always led by people. Otherwise what is even the point of all of this, rite? ❤️
