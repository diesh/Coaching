          <h1>How We'll Work Together</h1>
          <p>Coaching is a partnership built on trust, accountability, and growth. Here’s what you can expect from me and what I’ll expect from you.</p>
        </header>
      </div>

      <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>I’ll be on time and prepared for every session.</li>
        <li>You’ll receive a clear summary and agreed homework or reflection prompts after each meeting.</li>
        <li>Async support between sessions for questions, small check-ins, or encouragement when you need it.</li>
        <li>Our conversations will be confidential and judgment-free.</li>
        <li>I’ll challenge you thoughtfully, celebrate your wins, and help you stay accountable to your goals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I Expect From You</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>You’re here because you want to make meaningful change in your career and your team’s performance.</li>
        <li>You’ll show up for yourself. Come open, honest, and willing to do the work.</li>
        <li>You’ll complete reflection or exercises between sessions to keep making progress.</li>
        <li>You’ll attend our sessions on time and with presence.</li>
        <li>You’ll collaborate actively, share feedback, and speak up about what’s working or not.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Boundaries and Confidentiality</h2>

      <p>Everything we discuss stays between us unless you explicitly agree otherwise. I’m not a therapist, and I’ll always be transparent about the boundaries of my practice. This is a space for reflection, experimentation, and progress built on mutual respect and safety.</p>

      <h2>Our Shared Goal</h2>

      <p>I’ll work with you to set goals in our first session. Goal #1? To help you take control of your career and become the kind of leader your work and life are asking for.</p>

      <p>I’ll bring structure, challenge, and support; you’ll bring openness and follow-through. Together, we’ll make your next chapter intentional, confident, and grounded.</p>
