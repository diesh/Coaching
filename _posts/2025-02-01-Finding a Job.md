4 Ways to get your next job!

Looking for a job? Stressing about rent, food, and all the things? You're not alone. So many people are in the same boat, navigating the job market with worries piling up. It’s easy to get caught in a cycle of panic and frustration, but I’m here to offer some suggestions that might seem counterintuitive at first. I promise, though—focused, deliberate action leads to better results than desperate, all-over-the-place energy.

If everyone else is doing the same thing, it might be time to consider doing something different.

### 🌟 1) Apply for Fewer Jobs—But Do It Better

  <span class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></span> 
 <h3>It's who you know</h3>
Knowing someone who already works where you want to work is GOLD.  Get them to refer you!

</div>
Everyone’s throwing their hat in the ring for every open position, hoping something sticks. But what if you applied for fewer jobs? Take your time. Do your research. Focus on companies and cultures that align with what you actually want in a job—where you can be (at least somewhat) happy. Quality over quantity matters.

Taking the time to tailor your application and show why you’re genuinely excited about a role can make all the difference. Be intentional about where you focus your energy. A thoughtful application beats a scattershot approach every time.

### 🌟 2) Switch Up Your Case Study Format

Let’s be real—everyone is using the same old Problem / Process / Solution format for their case studies. It’s fine, but it doesn’t make you stand out. Try something fresh:

- Solution
- Puzzles to Solve
- Metrics That Had to Change
- Proof That It Worked

This approach flips the traditional format on its head and draws attention to your problem-solving skills and measurable impact right away. It also speaks to what hiring managers care about: results. Make it clear how you tackled challenges and achieved success, not just what the process was.

### 🌟 3) Focused Job Hunting, Not Frenzied Hustling

It’s exhausting to feel like you need to job search every single day. Instead, try focusing your job hunt on 2 or 3 days a week. Really go all-in during those days—apply, research, network. Then, give yourself the space to recharge. Take a couple of days to rest, reflect, and recover.

And I’m serious when I say it's ok to feel like garbage. Sometimes, you just need to feel what you’re feeling. The job search is a marathon, not a sprint, as cliched as that sounds. You’ll get better results if you conserve your energy and avoid burning out. Less stress, more focus.


### 🌟 4) Shift Your Mindset—Make It a Game

<div class="callout callout-right">
  <span class="fa fa-gamepad"></span> 
  <h3>Level up</h3>Typical cycle:<br /><code>job search > apply > wait... </code> 
  <br /><strong>Change your game plan:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Have coffee with someone.</li>
    <li>Ask how *you* can help them.</li>
    <li>Ask if they’ll refer you.</li>
    <li>Then, apply.</li>
  </ul>
Make your connections work for you. 👊
</div>Rejection sucks. Let’s get that out of the way. But getting discouraged by constant “no’s” isn’t helping. If you’ve sent 500 applications and received 499 rejections, it might be time to change something up. Think of the job search like a game—treat it as an experiment.

Adjust your approach and see what works. Tweak your resume. Change your outreach strategy. Don’t just keep hitting the same buttons expecting a different outcome. In gaming terms: boss level ≠ button mashing. Experiment, learn, and adapt until you find your winning formula.

### You’re Not Alone

If any of this resonates with you, I’m here to help. Coaching people through these tough times has been one of the most gratifying—and heart-wrenching—experiences. We’ll get through this. Focus on what you can control. The right opportunity will come, but you’ve got to focus your energy and make your job search intentional, not frantic.

So, what’s your next move? How are you approaching the job search in a way that stands out?
