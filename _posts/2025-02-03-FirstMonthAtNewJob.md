title: "How do I navigate my first month at a new job?!"
description: "The first few days at a new job can be nerve wracking! How does one stay sane, drink from the fire hose, stay focused, and make sense of the chaos? Plus getting to know people <i>and</i> getting them to know me?"

### The first month sets the tone... so set the tone!
Starting a new job is exciting—but also overwhelming. You're absorbing a firehose of information, meeting new people, and trying to figure out how everything fits together. One of the best ways to make sense of it all? Create a shared document to track what you're learning.

A simple structure—**Seeing, Hearing, Puzzles**—can help you organize observations, clarify insights, and accelerate your onboarding.

## 📝 The "Seeing, Hearing, Puzzles" Framework


### Why It Works

| Section  | What It Captures |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Seeing**  | Observations about customers, the product, and the overall experience of building and using it. |
| **Hearing**  | Themes and insights from team conversations, onboarding sessions, and leadership messaging. |
| **Puzzles**  | Gaps in understanding—things that don’t make sense yet but need clarity. |

This document fosters **transparency** and **alignment**, making it easier to surface questions, validate assumptions, and spark discussions with your manager and team. Over time, you'll move items from "Puzzles" into knowledge and actionable insights.

## 👀 Seeing: What Stands Out?

<div class="speechbubble">"What patterns am I noticing in how customers interact with our product? What patterns am I noticing in how customers interact with our product? What patterns am I noticing in how customers interact with our product? What patterns am I noticing in how customers interact with our product?"</div>

- Are there common pain points customers mention?
- Does the product deliver what it promises?
- How does the team approach problem-solving and decision-making?
- What feels surprisingly easy or unnecessarily difficult?

<div id="insight">
    <h3>💡 Pro Tip</h3>
    <p>Take screenshots, record demos, and capture key moments. Visuals help make insights more concrete.</p>
</div>

## 🎧 Hearing: What’s the Buzz?

<div class="speechbubble">"What words and phrases keep coming up in meetings and Slack?"</div>

- Are certain topics discussed frequently? (e.g., "_customer trust_" "_scaling challenges_")
- What's the general mood—enthusiastic, cautious, overwhelmed?
- How do people describe success? Metrics, gut feel, or a mix?
- Are there unspoken tensions or misalignments?

<div id="insight">
    <h3>🔍 Listen for Subtext</h3>
    <p>Pay attention to _how_ people say things—not just what they say. Enthusiasm, hesitation, or repeated concerns often signal deeper insights.</p>
</div>

## 🧩 Puzzles: What Doesn’t Make Sense (Yet)?

<div class="speechbubble">"What do I not know yet? What gaps in knowledge are holding the team back?"</div>

- Why do certain processes exist? Legacy reasons or real constraints?
- What trade-offs were made in past product decisions?
- Who owns which responsibilities? Are there overlaps or gaps?
- What’s expected of me in the next 30, 60, 90 days?

<div id="insight">
    <h3>🛠️ Turn Questions Into Conversations</h3>
    <p>Instead of waiting for clarity, actively seek it. Share your puzzles with your manager and peers to accelerate learning.</p>
</div>

## 🔗 Why Sharing This Matters

By keeping this document updated and **sharing it with your manager and team**, you:
- Show initiative and structured thinking.
- Help surface inconsistencies or gaps that others may not see.
- Encourage open discussions that lead to better alignment.

Your first month isn’t just about learning—it’s about **building trust and shaping how you contribute.** This simple framework makes that process easier.
