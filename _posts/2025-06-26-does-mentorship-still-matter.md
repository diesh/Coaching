_Is AI going to kill your job? 🤷‍♂️ AI can’t replace what happens between two people._

I think of that every time I see another *“10 ways to get AI to help you [fill in the blank].”*

I’m excited to have a powerful assistant ([who’s not MS Clippy](https://www.command.ai/blog/what-clippy-taught-us-all/) 📎). But the time we save by using AI for grunt work? That’s exactly the time we can use to reconnect—and regain what we’ve lost:

- the tradition of passing knowledge from one generation to the next  
- the art of storytelling that helps others do better  
- the wisdom of history that keeps us from repeating the [same mistakes over and over again](https://archive.ph/lqq8e)   

## Why Mentorship Still Matters

There’s no work relationship more sacred than mentorship. It’s not advice-giving or casual check-ins.

> Mentorship is an ongoing, purpose-driven relationship where an experienced human supports another’s growth by sharing wisdom, asking tough questions, offering perspective, and creating space for learning.

Structured mentorship builds confidence, clarity, and skill for the mentee. But it also gives back to the mentor. You sharpen what you know, unpack it, and make it relevant again—for others *and* for yourself. Your brain has to work to make your experience teachable.

[If AI is making us dumber](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ai-is-making-us-dumber-shocker/), mentorship does the opposite. It activates hearts and minds and makes both people more resilient to whatever comes next 🤖.

## The Core Ingredients of Mentorship

Mentorship takes work. It begins with a promise—and delivers on that promise through rhythm and intention.

Here are three essential elements:
<ul>
<li><b>Consistency</b> <br/>  
With scheduled check-ins, both people stay connected and grounded. “Let’s grab coffee again sometime” isn’t mentorship—it’s drift.
</li>
<li><b>Relevance</b>  <br />
Mentorship should be practical. The conversations should help the mentee tackle what's on their plate *now*. Defined topics keep it useful and honest.</li>
<li><b>Intentionality</b>  <br />
If there’s no structure or shared expectation, it’s not mentorship. It’s a good chat. And while good chats are great, mentorship goes deeper.</li>
</ul>

## A Practical Tool to Help You Start

I created a **Monthly Mentorship Template**—a tool I use in my coaching and leadership work.

It’s simple, adaptable, and designed for real human mentorship.

</a></div>
    <p> This template is designed specifically for mentorship that supports growth. You might use this with direct reports, peers, or people you're mentoring outside of work. Tweak it to suit your needs and cadence for mentorship sessions. I have suggested monthly sessions with a couple of async checkins.

### Inside the template:

- A monthly rhythm with async check-ins (adjust the cadence to suit your context)  
- Skill “pillars” to focus on growth: UX, UI, Design Systems, Product Thinking, Research + AI, Communication  
- Deep-dive prompts and reflection questions  
- A flexible format that works for async and structured 1:1 sessions  

Use it with someone you’re mentoring—and let me know how it goes. No one knows what’s coming next, but I know this for sure:

Mentorship gives back more than you’d expect. 💕
