    content: |
      Each week, we will focus on a different area of your leadership growth. Expect a combination of one-on-one coaching sessions, self-paced exercises, and actionable assignments that will help you build momentum and see results.
  - title: "Why This Works"
    items:
      - "Practical tools and strategies that you can apply at work the next day."
      - "Expert guidance to uncover blind spots, challenge assumptions, and make better decisions."
      - "Less reaction, and more intentional response to new situations. Develop the clarity to manage the unknown."
faq:
  - q: "How do I know if leadership coaching is right for me?"
    a: |
      If you’re looking to sharpen your leadership skills, improve decision-making, or navigate challenges with confidence, coaching can help.
      It’s for both experienced leaders and new ones who want to lead with clarity and impact.
  - q: "What kind of leaders do you coach?"
    a: |
      I work with executives, managers, and high-potential leaders in design, product, and tech.
      Whether you're stepping into leadership or refining your approach, coaching is tailored to your challenges.
      I also help leadership teams formulate and communicate strategy so they’re ready for what’s next. Check out [team workshops](TeamWorkshops.html) for more on how I help teams think creatively, collaborate effectively, and solve problems with confidence.
  - q: "How is coaching different from mentorship?"
    a: |
      Coaching helps you uncover your own answers through strategic questioning and reflection. Mentorship is more advice-based, sharing personal experiences. Coaching empowers you to shape your own leadership style and strategies.
      I’m here to hold up a mirror, helping you reflect on where you’ve been, where you’re going, and what’s possible. You’ll gain fresh perspectives, move forward with greater clarity, and take meaningful steps toward your goals.
  - q: "What results can I expect from coaching?"
    a: |
      The results can be life-changing if you're ready to put in the work. When you’re willing to step outside your comfort zone and challenge your blind spots, you’ll develop sharper decision-making skills, stronger communication, and a clearer leadership vision.
      You’ll gain strategies to navigate conflict, drive alignment, and create lasting impact in your organization. Think of me as your co-pilot, helping you tackle tough situations and equipping you with tools to handle challenges you haven’t faced before.
    
  - q: "Will my work pay for your coaching?"
    a: |
      - Many employers are open to covering coaching costs as part of their training and development allowance. 
      - I can help you build a strong case by framing coaching as a strategic investment in leadership capacity and career growth. 
      - I’ll provide invoices through my company so it fits seamlessly into your organization’s L&D or professional development process. 
      - Together, we’ll define high-level outcomes that align with your role and your company’s goals—so the value of this coaching is clear, measurable, and defensible.

  - q: "How often should I do coaching sessions?"
    a: |
      We will schedule sessions around your life so that you can realistically committ to the work you need to do for your self-improvement. Sessions can be every two weeks or once a month, allowing you time to apply insights between meetings. We’ll tailor a schedule that fits your goals and workload.
      If you're navigating a big career change or facing tough situations at work, I also offer weekly sessions with text check-ins between meetings to keep you on track.
  - q: "Next steps?"
    a: |
      Yay ✨ for wanting to take action and move to the next step. Let's do this!
      [Message me](#contact), and let’s set up an initial chat. I’ll reply to organize a session where we can get to know each other, ask questions, and make sure this partnership is the right fit.
      Excited to get to know you!
