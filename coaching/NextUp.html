        <h2 id="elements">Weekly Program</h2>
        <p>This 8-week journey blends reflection, action, and feedback. We'll meet 1:1 online each week, and you'll have exercises to move you forward between sessions.</p>

          <p>If you're ready to take action or have questions, 
          <a href="#contact" class="next scrolly">reach out to me</a>. 
          I'm excited to support your next chapter.
        </p>

        <blockquote>I’ve built this curriculum from years of experience, but the first session is always about rethinking and reshaping it around your goals. What follows is my ‘typical’ program, though in practice every journey is unique</blockquote>

      <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
      <h3 class="faq-question">Week 1: Personality &amp; Preferences</h3>
      <p class="short">Discover your core traits with a scientifically grounded assessment.</p>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>We begin with a personality assessment that maps your traits and work style to uncover what energizes you, what drains you, and where you naturally excel. This becomes the foundation for your career direction. Most people find this eye-opening because it highlights patterns, what draws you in and, just as importantly, what you are not interested in.</p>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>We’ll surface the skills you bring to the table and the gaps holding you back, then align them with career opportunities that fit your goals. Our work this week will help you define growth edges, things you want to learn, versus boundaries, things you don’t want to learn and that aren’t part of your career path. I will provide you with a framework to review your work experience through the lens of your skills and preferences, helping you sort through what fit with who you are versus what you had to do to keep your job.</p>

We’ll start the process together and I will provide you with the framework to continue refining on your own.</p>
