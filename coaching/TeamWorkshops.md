  - title: "What to Expect"
    content: |
      Each workshop is designed to be interactive, engaging, and results-oriented. Expect hands-on activities, collaborative exercises, and actionable takeaways that your team can implement immediately.
    items:
      - "<b>Tailored content</b>: Customized to your team’s goals and challenges."
      - "<b>Expert facilitation</b>: Guided by experienced professionals who bring real-world insights."
      - "<b>Tangible outcomes</b>: Clear next steps and deliverables to drive impact."
  - title: "Why This Works"
    items:
      - "The workshops are designed to provide your team with intentional collaboration, creativity, and alignment."
      - "Hands-on sessions give your team the practical tools and frameworks they need to tackle challenges with confidence."
      - "Every workshop delivers actionable takeaways that create lasting impact!"

faqs:
  - question: "How do you tailor workshops to my team’s specific needs?"
    answer:
      - "I begin each engagement with a discovery session where we discuss your team’s challenges, goals, and dynamics. Based on that, I design a session with hands-on exercises tailored to your needs. I have a few folks that I can also call upon to help me co-facilitate the sessions for larger groups."
  - question: "What’s the ideal team size for a workshop?"
    answer:
      - "The ideal size depends on the type of workshop, but typically 5–15 people allows for strong engagement and collaboration."
      - "Larger teams can benefit from more instructional workshops where we delve into topics to help build a strong culture such as unbiased hiring, building a culture of feedback and collaboration, and structured brainstorming."
  - question: "Do you offer virtual workshops or only in-person sessions?"
    answer:
      - "I offer both virtual and in-person workshops, depending on what works best for your team."
      - "Virtual workshops are designed to be just as interactive as in-person ones, with breakout sessions, moderated chats, and structured time for both collaborative work and self-reflection. I have conducted several workshops using online platforms such as Meet, Zoom, Teams etc. I'm based in Toronto and happy to travel for in-person sessions if preferred."
  - question: "Our team is shy / introverted / formal. Will this work for them?"
    answer:
      - "Yes! These workshops are built for all team dynamics, including quieter or more formal groups. Here's how I make sure everyone feels comfortable and engaged:"
      - "<ul>
          <li><strong>Options for participation</strong> – Not everyone loves speaking up in a big group. I use small breakouts, written reflections, and structured discussions so people can contribute in ways that feel natural.</li>
          <li><strong>No forced interaction</strong> – Activities are designed to be inclusive but not overwhelming. Team members can ease in at their own pace. I always follow up after sessions for folks who like time to reflect before contributing.</li>
          <li><strong>A thoughtful approach</strong> – I create a supportive, low-pressure environment where even the most reserved team members feel heard.</li>
          <li><strong>Engagement beyond talking</strong> – Collaboration doesn’t always mean speaking up. Many exercises involve writing, sketching, or structured brainstorming so ideas flow in different ways.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your team’s personality shapes the workshop, not the other way around. The goal is to create meaningful engagement in a way that works best for <strong>you.</strong></p>"
  - question: "Next steps?"
    answer:
      - "Yay ✨ for wanting to take action and move to the next step. Let's do this!"
      - "<a href=\"#contact\" class=\"next scrolly\">Message me</a>, and let’s set up an initial chat. I’ll reply to organize a session where we can get to know each other, ask questions, and make sure this partnership is the right fit."
      - "Excited to get to know you!"
