about_paragraphs:
  - I've spent over 20 years building things that people love to use. From founding DesignStamp in 2001 to leading design and research teams for organizations like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and PEPFAR, I’ve learned how to bring people together. Businesses, tech teams, and customers can co-create seamless, meaningful experiences.
  - Most recently, I served as VP of Experience Design &amp; Research at Thinkific, where I helped lead the team through its evolution into a unicorn and a successful IPO.
  - Today, I help leaders, high-performing professionals, and teams level up through coaching. I provide a practitioner’s perspective on influence, decision velocity, and building high-impact teams.
