about_paragraphs:
  - I've spent over 20 years building things that people love to use. From founding DesignStamp in 2001 to leading design and research teams for organizations like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and PEPFAR, I’ve learned how to bring people together. Businesses, tech teams, and customers can co-create seamless, meaningful experiences.
  - Most recently, I served as VP of Experience Design &amp; Research at Thinkific, where I played a role in helping the company hit unicorn status and go public in 2021.
  - Today, I help leaders, high-performing professionals, and teams level up through executive coaching. I collaborate with them to tackle big challenges and help create meaningful impact in their work.
